Date Picker was implemented using below reference code:
https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/user_interface/date_picker/

No artwork was used throughout application.

The Weight Tracker app is designed to allow users to be able to monitor progress being made while losing weight.

A number of features were implemented as a part of the current installation:

Works on all screen resolutions
Works with all screen resolutions regardless of orientation

There are a number of features that I was not able to implement in the current release, these are primarily:
Data continuity between sessions
Predicting future weight loss/body fat percentages
Ability to edit/remove weigh in entries
